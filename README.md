# HMM-POS-Tagger
Hidden Markov Model based Natural Language POS Tagger (Viterbi Decoding)


1. Implemented a Natural Language Part-of-Speech Tagger from scratch using a Hidden Markov (bigram) Model with Viterbi Algorithm (Dynamic Programming) for sequence decoding
2. Trained the Tagger on NLTKs treebank corpus, and applied Laplace smoothing for unseen and missing words
3. Used the inferences from the POS sentences to Improve Binary Sentiment Analysis Model
